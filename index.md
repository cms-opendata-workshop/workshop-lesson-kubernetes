A physics analysis usually encompasses running over hundreds of gigabytes of
data. At CMS, this is usually performed using high-throughput batch systems
such as the HTCondor installation at CERN and at other research institutions
as well as the worldwide LHC computing grid (WLCG). Not everyone will have
these resources available at their own institution, but nowadays anyone can
get access to computing resources via public cloud vendors.
This lesson will give you a first taste of running realistic physics analyses
"in the cloud" using Kubernetes (as well as giving you a brief introduction
to Kubernetes itself).
